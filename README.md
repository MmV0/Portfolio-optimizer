# Portfolio optimizer

This project is an exploration of different portfolio optimization techniques in the context of a diversified stock portfolio. The goal is to identify the optimal combination of stocks that will maximize returns while minimizing risk.

The project begins by selecting 20 stocks from 5 different sectors and creating a diversified portfolio in a target market. Four different portfolio models are then calculated and analyzed: the market portfolio, the minimum variance portfolio, the equally weighted portfolio, and the market-capitalization weighted portfolio.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is then used to analyze the performance of each portfolio and determine which approach is the most effective at balancing risk and reward. The analysis is based on Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory, which proposes that an investor can maximize returns by diversifying their portfolio and choosing investments with the highest expected returns for a given level of risk.

Through this project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the trade-offs involved in portfolio optimization and identify strategies for maximizing returns while minimizing risk.
