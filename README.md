# Portfolio optimizer
As part of Security, Features and Option (SFO) module I developed a portfolio for a client who is looking for a 5-year investment in **any equity market** and would like exposure to a diversified portfolio, invested in **20 stocks across five sectors**.

After deciding which country to invest in, selecting five sectors and choosing four securities for each sector, the goal was to create a diversified portfolio. The Portfolio_optimiser.ipynb reports the code used to calculate the optimal portfolio.
